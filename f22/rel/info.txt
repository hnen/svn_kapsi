                                      f:f22.0

F  is  an  uncommon  psychiatric  condition  in  which  patients  present  with
circumscribed  symptoms  of  non - bizarre  delusions,  but with the absence of
prominent hallucinations and no thought disorder, mood disorder, or significant
flattening  of  affect.[1]  For  the  diagnosis to be made, auditory and visual
hallucinations  cannot be prominent, though olfactory or tactile hallucinations
related   to   the    content    of    the    delusion   may   be   present.[2]
